</h2>
<br>

<p style="color:black; margin-bottom: 50px"> I grew up outside a smaller city named DeKalb, IL; about two hours west of Chicago. My father was a police officer and my mother worked at a grocery store in the deli preparing sandwiches and anything baking related. I am proud to say that my entire family instilled the habits of working hard in terms of manual labor early in my life. During my high school years I would work in the corn fields, bale hay, and do landscaping projects for people who would trust a young high school student to recreate their outdoor decor! </p>

<h3 style="color:purple; margin-left: 10px;opacity: 100px"> The College Years...
	
</h3>

<p> I began my studies at the University of Iowa. Originally I pursued a career in medicine and invested many hours into the sciences, such as:
	<ul>
		Chemistry,
		Biology,
		Microbiology, and
		Pharmacological Science
	</ul>
	
Ultimately, I did not get accepted into any medical school due to my average GPA being lower than the norm. It took me a long time for that particular reality to set in because I put countless hours and dedication for everything to hit a complete mental obstruction. At that point, I did not know what I was to do with my life...

</h4>

<p> After I left Iowa, I had nowhere to claim as home. I would spend the remainder of my time and finances wandering throughout the midwest. I learned how to survive without relying on others for assistance and how to live in a car and still take care of myself. At one point in time I felt that this life was not going to be any easier. I cried out to God, whom I never lost faith in, begging for him to take me away from this Earth and to make the pain erase itself on my soul. I can remember the day when I made that final cry for help, and He answered......

</h5>

<p> His guiding light led me to joining the military, more specifically, the Air Force. During my enlistment of 6 years, I was blessed with two sons, Christian and Cameron. I was deployed twice, each lasting 6 months at a time. The most challenging part of a deployment was not the fear and violence, it was leaving my oldest son when he was only 2 months old. There were times in the desert when I didn't think I was going to make it home, but I knew my family would be cared for in case the worst happened.

<h6> Present and the Future
	
</h6>

<p> Now that my life has been more stable than years past, I have been able to spend more time with my sons. I work for the Dept of Veterans Affairs investigating claim fraud and other related job tasks. I discovered the FSDI program at SDGKU and felt that this would be an excellent investment towards a future where society is almost completely rooted in technology. Do I know where my future is going to be next? Not at all, but with my children being spoiled beyond belief and having an extremely comfortable and safe lifestyle, whatever the future thinks it can hurt me with is met with a laugh and the statement,"Watch this..."
